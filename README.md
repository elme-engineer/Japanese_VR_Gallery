# Japanese_VR_Gallery

This game takes place in front of a Japanese temple, where a gallery of objects related to Japanese culture is displayed. Players can explore a small map and interact with the objects in the environment. There are three interactive objects: a katana, time orbs, and Sun Wukong’s magical staff. Each object behaves differently and offers unique interactions.

## Controls

Players can move around using the left joystick on the controller and rotate using the right joystick. The grab button on each controller allows players to pick up objects. The trigger button also enables interaction, but it is used exclusively with the time orb.

## Actions
